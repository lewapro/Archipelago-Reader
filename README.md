Update 2:
New design! Some parts are customizable!
Freezing issues with too many messages are fixed! (needs testing).
Everything is resizable!
Revert your settings if you played a little too much with them (you can also modify your config.py).

--

Open the .exe
A resisable window will open and config.py will be created near the executable.
Top right corner is settings button.

For localhost use ws://localhost:38281
For public lobbies use wss://archipelago.gg:38281

Enter the server url (ex: wss://archipelago.gg:51478, for localhost use ws://)
Enter a single player name (any that you use)
Enter password if there is one.
Enter a single game your chosen name is playing.
Enter nothing, one or multiple names you wish to target (ex: lewaproTF2, lewaproPaint, lewaproJigsaw, lewapro). If you leave it empty, you will see every player (please test it with a lot of players).

After saving settings try connecting (button on top left). We are expecting "Connected". In case it is not "Connected" check your settings and try finding mistakes, in other case if you think that problem is not on your side, close the application and refuse to continue. (There is no console yet, sorry) (maybe you can use cmd to see console? Who knows? not me).
