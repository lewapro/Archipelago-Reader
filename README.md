Open the .exe
A resisable window will open and config.py will be created near the executable.
Top right corner is settings button.
Enter the server url (ex: wss://archipelago.gg:51478, for localhost use ws://)
Enter a single player name (any that you use)
Enter password if there is one.
Enter a single game your chosen name is playing.
Enter one or multiple names you wish to target (ex: lewaproTF2, lewaproPaint, lewaproJigsaw, lewapro).

After saving settings try connecting (button on top left). We are expecting "Connected". In case it is not "Connected" check your settings and try finding mistakes, in other case if you think that problem is not on your side, close the application and refuse to continue. (There is no console yet, sorry).
